It supports:\n\n- One-click deployments\n- Automatic SSL certificates\n- Docker container management\n- Database management\n- Service monitoring\n- And much more!\n\n### Setting Up Your Server\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to getting started:\n\n1. **Create a Hetzner Account**\n   - Sign up at [hetzner.com](https://www.hetzner.com/)\n   - Add a payment method\n   - Create a new project\n\n2. **Create a Server**\n   - Choose a location (I recommend Germany for EU users)\n   - Select an instance type (CPX21 is a good starting point)\n   - Choose Ubuntu as your OS\n   - Add your SSH key\n   - Create the server\n\n3. **Initial Server Setup**\n   ```bash\n   # Update system packages\n   apt update && apt upgrade -y\n\n   # Install basic utilities\n   apt install -y curl wget git ufw\n\n   # Configure firewall\n   ufw allow 22\n   ufw allow 80\n   ufw allow 443\n   ufw enable\n   ```\n\n4. **Install Coolify**\n   ```bash\n   # Run the installation script\n   wget -q https://get.coolify.io -O install.sh\n   sudo bash ./install.sh\n\n   # Follow the prompts and save your credentials\n   ```\n\n5. **Configure Domain**\n   - Point your domain to your server's IP\n   - Add A records for wildcard subdomains\n   ```\n   A     @     YOUR_SERVER_IP\n   A     *     YOUR_SERVER_IP\n   ```\n\n### Deploying Your First App\n\nOnce Coolify is set up, deploying applications is straightforward:\n\n1. Connect your Git repository\n2. Choose your deployment settings\n3. Add any environment variables\n4. Click deploy!\n\n### Monitoring and Maintenance\n\nCoolify provides built-in monitoring, but here are some additional tips:\n\n1. **Regular Backups**\n   ```bash\n   # Create a backup script\n   mkdir -p /root/backups\n   coolify backup create --destination /root/backups\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Regularly**\n   ```bash\n   # Update Coolify\n   coolify update\n\n   # Update system packages\n   apt update && apt upgrade -y\n   ```\n\n3. **Monitor Resources**\n   - Use Coolify's built-in monitoring\n   - Consider adding Netdata for more detailed metrics\n   - Set up email alerts for critical events\n\n### Cost Breakdown\n\nHere's what I'm paying monthly:\n\n- Hetzner CPX21: €10.84\n- Domain: ~€1\n- Total: ~€12/month\n\nThis setup hosts:\n- Multiple Node.js applications\n- Several static sites\n- PostgreSQL databases\n- Redis instances\n- Monitoring tools\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n1. **Always use SSH keys** - disable password authentication\n2. **Keep everything updated** - both the OS and Coolify\n3. **Use strong passwords** for Coolify admin\n4. **Enable automatic backups**\n5. **Regularly check logs** for suspicious activity\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSelf-hosting with Hetzner and Coolify has been a game-changer for my projects. It provides the perfect balance of control and convenience, all while keeping costs low. The initial setup might take a bit of time, but the long-term benefits are worth it.\n\nRemember, while this setup works great for many use cases, it might not be suitable for everyone. Consider your specific needs, technical expertise, and maintenance capacity before making the switch.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have questions about this setup!","src/content/blog/self-hosting-hetzner-coolify.md","8d938f80f0e740c2",{"html":85,"metadata":86},"\u003Cp>After years of using various cloud providers and PaaS solutions, I’ve finally settled on a setup that gives me the perfect balance of control, cost, and ease of use: Hetzner Cloud for infrastructure and Coolify for deployment and management.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"why-self-host\">Why Self-Host?\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>While platforms like Vercel and Netlify are fantastic for many use cases, there are several compelling reasons to consider self-hosting:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Cost-effectiveness\u003C/strong>: For multiple projects, self-hosting can be significantly cheaper\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Control\u003C/strong>: Full control over your infrastructure and data\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Privacy\u003C/strong>: Your data stays on your servers\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Learning\u003C/strong>: Great way to understand infrastructure and DevOps\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"why-hetzner\">Why Hetzner?\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.hetzner.com/\">Hetzner\u003C/a> offers some of the most competitive prices in the market while maintaining excellent quality:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Servers starting at €4.15/month\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Locations in Germany, Finland, and the USA\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Great network performance\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Simple but powerful API\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Excellent documentation\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>I’m currently using their CPX21 instance (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM) which costs around €10.84/month and handles multiple projects with ease.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"enter-coolify\">Enter Coolify\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://coolify.io/\">Coolify\u003C/a> is an open-source, self-hosted Heroku/Netlify alternative that makes deploying and managing applications a breeze.

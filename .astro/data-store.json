It supports:\n\n- One-click deployments\n- Automatic SSL certificates\n- Docker container management\n- Database management\n- Service monitoring\n- And much more!\n\n### Setting Up Your Server\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to getting started:\n\n1. **Create a Hetzner Account**\n   - Sign up at [hetzner.com](https://www.hetzner.com/)\n   - Add a payment method\n   - Create a new project\n\n2. **Create a Server**\n   - Choose a location (I recommend Germany for EU users)\n   - Select an instance type (CPX21 is a good starting point)\n   - Choose Ubuntu as your OS\n   - Add your SSH key\n   - Create the server\n\n3. **Initial Server Setup**\n   ```bash\n   # Update system packages\n   apt update && apt upgrade -y\n\n   # Install basic utilities\n   apt install -y curl wget git ufw\n\n   # Configure firewall\n   ufw allow 22\n   ufw allow 80\n   ufw allow 443\n   ufw enable\n   ```\n\n4. **Install Coolify**\n   ```bash\n   # Run the installation script\n   wget -q https://get.coolify.io -O install.sh\n   sudo bash ./install.sh\n\n   # Follow the prompts and save your credentials\n   ```\n\n5. **Configure Domain**\n   - Point your domain to your server's IP\n   - Add A records for wildcard subdomains\n   ```\n   A     @     YOUR_SERVER_IP\n   A     *     YOUR_SERVER_IP\n   ```\n\n### Deploying Your First App\n\nOnce Coolify is set up, deploying applications is straightforward:\n\n1. Connect your Git repository\n2. Choose your deployment settings\n3. Add any environment variables\n4. Click deploy!\n\n### Monitoring and Maintenance\n\nCoolify provides built-in monitoring, but here are some additional tips:\n\n1. **Regular Backups**\n   ```bash\n   # Create a backup script\n   mkdir -p /root/backups\n   coolify backup create --destination /root/backups\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Regularly**\n   ```bash\n   # Update Coolify\n   coolify update\n\n   # Update system packages\n   apt update && apt upgrade -y\n   ```\n\n3. **Monitor Resources**\n   - Use Coolify's built-in monitoring\n   - Consider adding Netdata for more detailed metrics\n   - Set up email alerts for critical events\n\n### Cost Breakdown\n\nHere's what I'm paying monthly:\n\n- Hetzner CPX21: €10.84\n- Domain: ~€1\n- Total: ~€12/month\n\nThis setup hosts:\n- Multiple Node.js applications\n- Several static sites\n- PostgreSQL databases\n- Redis instances\n- Monitoring tools\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n1. **Always use SSH keys** - disable password authentication\n2. **Keep everything updated** - both the OS and Coolify\n3. **Use strong passwords** for Coolify admin\n4. **Enable automatic backups**\n5. **Regularly check logs** for suspicious activity\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSelf-hosting with Hetzner and Coolify has been a game-changer for my projects. It provides the perfect balance of control and convenience, all while keeping costs low. The initial setup might take a bit of time, but the long-term benefits are worth it.\n\nRemember, while this setup works great for many use cases, it might not be suitable for everyone.

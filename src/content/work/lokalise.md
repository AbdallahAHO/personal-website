At Lokalise, I lead projects that significantly enhance user onboarding, activation, and billing through advanced AI integrations like OpenAI GPT. Notably, I delivered an ROI Calculator from concept to release, tackling complex user needs through effective prototyping, technical refinement, and alignment with strategic product objectives.

I've successfully implemented critical billing and monetization features within Flow, aligning closely with UX designers to ensure seamless, high-quality experiences. With strong analytical skills and a user-centric approach, I continue to improve product clarity and stability, advocating for a consistent vision focused on user-value.

My goal is to deepen involvement in strategic, technically challenging projects, enhance my architectural decision-making capabilities, and expand mentorship engagements to drive impactful, company-wide initiatives.

At Postman, I was the Technical Lead for a newly formed Growth team, responsible for driving user engagement and retention through impactful features and strategic enhancements.

Key achievements included launching collection templates that garnered over 45,000 imports within three months, significantly improving onboarding experiences. I introduced advanced LLM-powered functionalities, enabling automatic collection generation from user code, substantially increasing new user engagement. Additionally, I streamlined our A/B testing processes and mentored junior engineers, strengthening team efficiency and fostering innovation.

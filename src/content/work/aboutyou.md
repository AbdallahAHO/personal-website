At ABOUT YOU, my first professional role in Germany, I joined the multicultural Checkout team—comprised of members from over 15 nationalities—where I contributed to expanding the e-commerce platform across four European markets.

I developed and deployed custom checkout flows, integrated various payment methods, and implemented store-issued gift card functionalities. Additionally, I created a robust universal tracking solution, optimizing future development and checkout enhancements. This role provided foundational experience in e-commerce and international collaboration.

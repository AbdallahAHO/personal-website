At XING, I began my journey in Growth Engineering, initially focused on optimizing the onboarding process, significantly boosting premium user conversions through targeted experiments and user-centered design.

Advancing into a Senior Frontend Engineer role, I collaborated closely with core teams responsible for user profiles and networking features. I streamlined internal development workflows, improving team productivity, and actively mentored junior engineers, helping foster a collaborative, growth-oriented culture. My contributions at XING emphasized user-centric development, team efficiency, and impactful growth strategies.

          My name is Abdallah Othman, a Software Engineer with over eight years
          of experience in the craft of digital experiences that users genuinely
          enjoy. Originally from Alexandria, Egypt, I've made Hamburg, Germany
          my home—a vibrant city whose creative energy and cultural diversity
          continuously inspire my work.
          <br />
          <br />
          My journey began from pure curiosity since I was 12, staying there in my
          bedroom, toying around with an old Intel Pentium III XP PC, got into programming
          and web developement picking up my older brother 1000-pages HTML 5.0 reference
          and hacking out my way to make my first .tk website with MS Frontpage (deleting
          few dll32 files for the sake of it).
          <br />
          <br />
          Few years later of hacking till I got my CompSci Degree, I had a chance
          to build up my craft and getting paid for it, expanded through hands-on
          roles at companies like ABOUT YOU, XING, Postman, and currently {
            `${SITE.CURRENT_COMPANY}`
          }. Each role has given me the privilege of working with diverse,
          multicultural teams, enhancing my skills in communication and
          leadership as profoundly as my technical capabilities.
          <br />
          <br />
          I thrive in collaborative, asynchronous, remote-first environments where
          craftsmanship, transparency, and continuous learning form the core of our
          culture. My primary stack includes TypeScript, React, and Node.js, and
          my expertise in Growth Engineering allows me to build scalable products
          and optimize user experiences effectively.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently, I am particularly excited about exploring generative AI and
          Large Language Models (LLMs). I'm passionate about leveraging these technologies
          to create innovative, engaging user experiences, especially tools tailored
          for Arabic-speaking markets and family-oriented workflows.
          <br />
          <br />
          Outside of coding, you’ll often find me immersed in Hamburg’s dynamic music
          scene, attending concerts at the Elbphilharmonie, or working on side projects
          through my experimental platform, Escalay. The intersections of music,
          culture, and technology fascinate me, driving much of my creative exploration.
          <br />
          <br />
          This website is my digital home, an open space to share my projects, insights
          into technology, and reflections on my journey as an Egyptian engineer
          living in Germany. Whether you’re here for technical content or intrigued
          by the crossroads of culture and code, welcome
          <br /><br />
          I’m glad you stopped by.
